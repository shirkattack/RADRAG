## About This Repository

In this repository, you will find: 
Custom Scripts: Tailored solutions utilizing RAG techniques to enhance information retrieval and generation tasks.
Jupyter Notebooks: Detailed, interactive notebooks demonstrating the implementation and potential of our scripts in real-world scenarios.
Community Contributions: A space for collaboration where AI researchers can share their insights, suggest improvements, and contribute to the ongoing development of our tools.

## Monthly Updates

Every month, we commit to:

Provide RAG and Agent-based through notebooks or scripts complete with explanations, use cases, and examples to facilitate understanding and experimentation.

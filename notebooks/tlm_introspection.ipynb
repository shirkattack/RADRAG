    "The correction mechanism engages the AI agent in iterative refinement of its responses. The refinement process looks at the TLM scores provided by Cleanlab as a 3rd party measure to ensure that the final output is both accurate and reliable.

    "1. Expand to Other Domains: Apply this reflection-correction mechanism to other sensitive fields such as healthcare, finance, and legal domains to improve the accuracy and reliability of LLM outputs.\n",
    "2. Real-Time Applications: Develop real-time applications where this technique can be used to provide on-the-fly corrections in conversational AI systems.\n",
    "3. Automated Feedback Loops: Integrate automated feedback loops where the LLM continuously learns from its corrections and improves over time without human intervention.\n",
    "4. Enhanced Stopping Criteria: Experiment with more sophisticated stopping criteria that can better determine when the reflection-correction cycle should end.\n",
    "\n",
    "By pursuing these directions, we can further enhance the robustness and trustworthiness of AI systems, making them more suitable for a wide range of applications."
